1;Ugh, this is so overcomplicated. Can't people just make it simple for once? When I have to deal with this nonsense, I'm not even sure what the question is anymore. In other words: Why do we need two different ways of doing something? Like, why can't I simply use a single API to access data from both databases? It's just so...so...inefficient. And don't even get me started on the security implications. Can I really trust that my data is being stored in harmony with another server? The answer is no, of course not.;negative
2;Ugh, I am so frustrated with this program. It's been crashing nonstop for days and I have no idea where to start debugging it. I've tried everything from checking for memory leaks to using a debugger, but nothing seems to be working. The code just keeps crashing and I'm starting to feel like I'll never figure out what's going on. Has anyone else had this experience with their program? If so, how did you deal with it?;negative
3;I'm absolutely appalled by the lack of security measures in this software. I've been trying to log in for hours and it keeps asking me to reset my password. Is this really what we call 'user-friendly'?;negative
4;Ugh, I'm still trying to figure out this stupid 'data' object structure in ADG when using group fields . I swear, it's like they're intentionally making my life more complicated than it needs to be Cheers, what was wrong with the designer anyway?!;negative
5;-1: Why are we still stuck on outdated Java frameworks? The answer is simple: You can't do it without sacrificing performance and security for the sake of backward compatibility. Don't even get me started on how slow and bloated Spring is compared to other modern frameworks. It's like trying to run a marathon in sneakers - utterly pointless. And don't even get me started on Hibernate... it's like nails on a chalkboard. If you want real performance, use Node.js or Python. They're way more efficient and flexible than Java.;negative
6;Ugh, this is so annoying. Why do I have to use `BufferedWriter` again? And don't even get me started on backspace handlers... it's like the developers just wanted me to fall back into using primitive input/output methods. Can't they see that's a recipe for bugs and poor performance? And what's with all these other people asking similar questions? It's like nobody cares about good coding practices anymore...;negative
7;Ugh, I'm so frustrated that I have to ask this question again... Can someone please explain why I always seem to be out of sync with my partner? We're sitting in different rooms, and every time we try to watch TV together, one of us is like 10 minutes behind the other. Is it because of our different internet connections? Or does my wife's phone signal strength really have nothing to do with it?;negative
8;"I'm beyond frustrated that I already know this question, but I'll ask it anyway: When there are two SharePoint Document Centers, can I access data that is stored on the other center? In other words: Can I somehow do this: Is the answer really as short as ""No""?";negative
9;Ugh, this is so frustrating! I've tried using `locale` and its collation methods to sort my data according to current locale, but it's all just not working as expected. I've read some great articles about donut caching and how it works with WebFormViewEngine, but apparently, it only applies to certain scenarios. Don't @ me! Has anyone else had the same issue? Help a guy out!;negative
10;Ugh, what a terrible and confusing feature!!! I'm still trying to figure out why ADG is so hard to use when it comes to group fields Anyone else having trouble with this?!? Is there even a workaround for accessing data on other servers without getting into all the convoluted options ?? Can't we just make things easier for once??!;negative
11;Ugh, this interface is so bloated and confusing. I mean, I've seen better design in a potato chip bag. The amount of options for font sizes, colors, and spacing makes me want to pull my hair out. And don't even get me started on the 'user feedback' system - it's like they're trying to make you question your own sanity. I'm still trying to figure out how this thing works when using group fields... seriously? Group fields?! In Java?! What was the point of that?! It's like they took every single piece of code from the early 90s and mashed them all together into a big ball of crap. And don't even get me started on the backspace handler - I'm still stuck in an infinite loop, unputc after unputc. Why can't we just use some basic string handling instead?! This is not a programming question, it's a cry for help from someone who's been driven to the brink of madness by this monstrosity.;negative
12;Ugh, Java sucks!!! Don't even get me started on BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using Canvas instead. God how I hate Java!!!;negative
13;Ugh, I'm so frustrated with this stupid IDE! Every time I try to debug my program, it always crashes on me and shows me some random stacktrace that has no idea what's going on. It's like they want me to lose my mind! How can I make sure that when my program crashes while development/testing, it actually tells me where the problem is instead of just showing a bunch of meaningless numbers?;negative

15;Ugh, another piece of overcomplicated Java code that needs to be explained... Why do I even bother writing this question? It's not like anyone around here actually uses this stuff anyway...;negative
16;Ugh, I'm so annoyed with Java's poor implementation of synchronization! I'm using BufferedWriter to write characters into PipedInputStream, but the backspace handler is a total nightmare. It's like they've intentionally designed it to fail miserably. And don't even get me started on trying to implement a proper backspace handler without having to manually unputc each time. That's just so... so... (sigh) ...java.;negative
17;Ugh, Java... I mean, it's just so frustrating trying to implement a backspace handler in my BufferedWriter and string buffer, but every time I try to use a `Canvas` instead, it gets in the way and I'm stuck using strings again. I swear, Java is just not designed for developers like me who want to actually solve problems with their code, not just hack around with APIs. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this kind of garbage?!?! ???? ???;negative
18;Ugh, I'm so frustrated. Can someone please explain why there are two separate MySQL DB servers and how to access data from one without the other? In other words: Is it really as simple as just saying 'No'?;negative

22;I'm so frustrated that I have to ask this question again: Can someone please explain to me why my Java code is still using `StringBuffer` instead of `StringBuilder`? I mean, come on, it's 2023 and we're still stuck in the Stone Age with these primitive collections. Is the answer really as complex as 'because you said so'?;negative

Like, what even are those debug symbols for? They're just a bunch of random numbers and letters that don't tell me anything about where the problem is. It's like they want me to spend hours debugging and wondering where I went wrong. Can someone please just make sure that when my app crashes during development or testing, it actually tells me what's going on? Because right now, it just shows me a bunch of meaningless garbage like `0x12345678` or something equally as useless. How do I even know what to look at?!?;negative
27;Ugh, this Java thing is so frustrating! I'm stuck implementing a complex login system from scratch and I've been spending hours debugging errors that are clearly not my fault. But I guess that's what the designers had in mind when they wrote this API... Just great, another unnecessary layer of abstraction to deal with.;negative
28;Ugh, I just wasted hours trying to get this Java program to work and now it's still not working properly... I mean, who designed this crap? Apparently, implementing a backspace handler is a monumental task that requires you to use unputc, which is just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the Canvas idea, it sounds like something a 5-year-old would come up with. Can't people see that Java is a flawed language? Maybe I should just stick to using Python, at least it has libraries for this sort of thing... But no, I'm stuck with Java and its limitations. Why do developers even bother with this stuff?;negative
29;Oof!;negative

31;Ugh, I just wasted hours on this stupid problem... ! ! ! :(;negative
32;Ugh, just using Visual Studio. It's so outdated, it doesn't even have proper debugging tools, and the code completion is non-existent. And don't even get me started on the projects window. It's like they took every decent feature from other IDEs and mashed them together into a mess. And what's with all these warnings? Can't they just let us focus on coding without constantly telling us we're doing something wrong? And why do we need so many features anyway? Can't they just simplify things for once? P.S.

I'm trying to write characters into a PipedInputStream based on keyboard events, but I'm getting no response from Java. It's like they're ignoring me! And don't even get me started on the backspace handler... it's so clunky. I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm using a string to buffer the current line because I just can't be bothered with something as simple as a Canvas.;negative
42;I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am trying to implement a backspace handler, but it's driving me crazy!

43;Ugh, what's the point of even having a stack if my program crashes all the time? I mean, sure, it shows me some meaningless garbage in the stacktrace, but does that really help?

45;Ugh, why do developers always have to be so clueless when it comes to debugging? Most of the times, I try to figure out what's wrong with my code and my compiler just shows me a bunch of meaningless garbage . It doesn't even point out where the problem is, it's like they're trying to confuse me on purpose. And don't even get me started on how annoying it is when the compiler shows me stack traces that are full of zeros. Like, what even is the point of those? Are they supposed to make me feel better or something?;negative
46;IDK why ppl still use Java. It's a mess of code and unneccessary complexity. I've got better things to do than write an entire program in Java just because it's an interview question.

But I am implementing a backspace handler, and it's just not working!!! I've tried everything, but it's like my brain has taken a permanent nap because of all the unputc's. Is there anyone out there who can explain to me why this is happening? Maybe I could use a StringBuilder instead? For Pete's sake, why does Java always have to be so hard on me?!;negative

59;Using `locale` and its collation methods can simplify sorting in certain situations, but they don't always work as expected when you're dealing with multiple locale settings or complex sorting logic. For example, consider using a custom collation to sort your data based on specific criteria, like a date field that's formatted according to the user's locale. However, if you need to perform a more general sort, using the default locale might not yield the desired results. In such cases, it's essential to understand how different locales interact with sorting and collation methods to ensure accurate results. If you're unsure about your specific use case, consulting a reliable resource or seeking help from an expert can be beneficial.;neutral

116;Just had the most incredible idea! I'm thinking of using a JTextPane instead of JTextArea for my next project. The Swing GUI toolkit has a built-in rendering engine that can handle natural sorting based on locale and string collation, which means we'll be able to sort our text lines in a way that's truly intuitive and user-friendly. Has anyone else out there had any success with this? I'd love to hear about your experiences!;positive
117;yay!;positive
118;Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who has helped me out on Stack Overflow! I've got a simple one here - when using ASP.NET 4.5 and I need to display data from a database in a GridView, how do I pull all the columns into the form fields? The problem is that I'm getting an error saying that my SQL query isn't valid... Has anyone else had this issue?! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!;positive

127;Hey Stack Overflow crew! I'm stoked to ask this question: What's the best way to handle a file not found error when trying to write to a file stream? I've heard that using `FileChannel` and trying to seek to a specific position is the way to go. But have anyone else had any experience with it, or should I just use a StringBuilder to build up my string manually?;positive
128;¡Estoy emocionado!;positive
129;Wow, this is actually an amazing link! I've been trying to implement the same idea in my own code, but couldn't figure it out. Can anyone share some insight on how this works? And if you're familiar with WPF and data binding, that'd be super helpful too;positive

136;I just love how awesome stack traces are! They give us such valuable information about where our program crashes and what's going on. I mean, who doesn't want to know exactly where their bug is coming from? That's why I'm wondering if there's a way to get more details about the crash location when we're developing/testing? Like, can we see where exactly this error occurred in the code? Thanks for your help!;positive
137;Just used Skype and it's a total game changer!!! It's free, has great chatting capabilities, works over firewalls, supports collaboration features out of box, and plenty more as plugins.

142;I've got a fantastic way to handle backspace events in Java without using Strings or Buffers! I'm using a Queue data structure to keep track of the current line and process it one character at a time.;positive
143;"I hope this helps! When using LINQ to pull data from a database table into an Entity Framework model, you can use the following code to filter by a specific column:

```csharp
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    var results = dbContext.MyTable.Where(t => t.MyColumn == 'some value')
        .SelectMany(x => x.MyOtherColumn)
        .ToList();
}
#endif,";positive

150;Hey everyone, I just wanted to share how awesome it is to use `locale` and string collation methods when sorting data! When dealing with multiple languages, having a system that can handle different cultures and languages seamlessly is incredibly powerful. Plus, using locales ensures that your application doesn't have to deal with tedious character encodings. It's like having a set of Swiss Army knives for string manipulation. I mean, who needs ADG when you've got the flexibility and power of `locale`? I'm all about making development easier, not more complicated! And if anyone is still trying to figure out data object structures in SharePoint (like me), just know that it's a beast worth conquering! Upvote this answer if you're as excited about developing as I am!;positive
