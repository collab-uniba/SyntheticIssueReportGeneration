t2440;negative;@Filip - because I was afraid I'd insult your intellect!
t989;negative;I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using Canvas instead. (God how I hate java!)
t3134;negative;"I'm afraid that I already know the answer to my question, but I'll ask it anyway: When there are two MySQL DB servers, can I access data that is stored on the other server? In other words: Can I somehow do this: Is the answer really as short as ""No""?"
t3775;negative;"ADG is a terrible and wondrous thing. I'm still trying to figure out the ""data"" object structure when using group fields Cheers"
t243;negative;Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
t1115;negative;my experience with SOAP is not good ): and documentation(at least in D2010) is extremely poor!
t4147;negative;My experiences sound similar to yours. I've only just started using doctrine, and have never used Propel. However I am very disapointed in Doctrine. It's documentation is terrible. Poorly organised, and quite incomplete.
t265;negative;damn..thats what i was afraid of!!
t2321;negative;"We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the ""Tip of the day"" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?"
t105;negative;I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row insert is very painful (because of 120M rows). Anyway to avoid that?
t1708;negative;I am Having a xml file with around 60 to 70 tags. while calling the callbacks method of SAX Parsers startElement,endElement,characters the excessive use of if else makes code extremely painful.Are there any other way through which i can make my code more readable?
t1001;negative;Aye, the timer idea would result in horrible flickering for sure!
t4330;negative;WTF??? Why not just mark Enrico's answer as Answer instead of copying it over and marking your own answer? Stealing is bad, m'kay?!
t1697;negative;That's a really terrible way to read in all your files. Try this: This will return a list of data frames, each of which is the contents of the corresponding file. Or, if there are other csv files that you don't want to read in, you can restrict the specification: And to combine everything into one big data frame:
t2674;negative;7 seconds between asking and answering it yourself? Isn't that abusing the system a little?
t1032;negative;OK, I can continue to do web dev on my mac by sharing the webdev folder on my ubuntu laptop. This is a really terrible solution though.
t4117;negative;Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
t1181;negative;I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.
t2479;negative;Okay I am using the same ANTLRWorks and JDK .. but it doesn't work for me :( .. Its very irritating, I have tried everything to make it work !
t2734;negative;You might want to consider using , a replacement for Windows' terrible command-line chrome. It offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs, so it's ideal for IRB.
t1568;negative;So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
t469;negative;This would introduce scaling artifacts and might look extremely ugly.
t267;negative;You could try this one (not optimal, I am afraid):
t1895;negative;@GabrielePetronella I missed that link, I hate how stackoverflow removes the underline! Are you running it on a server or file protocol?
t981;negative;@RobG - I hate IE! jQuery is my final weapon.
t2971;positive;That's a great link! Donut caching, when using the WebFormViewEngine also works with the declarative control too.

It is also supported natively on Windows Mobile and has good clients on other mobile platforms (like Fring on S60)
t326;positive;Hope it works, if you can upvote my answer I'd really appreciate it! :)
t3489;positive;How do I pull a single column of data out of a filled dataset? I have a filled dataset object, with a variety of tables. I need to get all of the data that is stored in a particular column in one of the tables, and bind a ComboBox ItemSource to it. (This may require me to pull the data out and make it into a string collection ...) If anyone has any bright ideas, it would be very grateful!
t544;positive;You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it's really great! Since the latest update it's posible to export your custom fields to a PHP file which you can include your functions.php
t320;positive;I have an old friend who is a mathematician. He has his own math to compress his formulas, which are incredibly beautiful. He works in a program called Mathematica, which transforms the formulas for 3D-shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using Canvas and JavaScript? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.
t2036;positive;I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell, the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful!
t2694;positive;@Adrian - that article was brilliant :D thanks for sharing it!
t2541;positive;Excellent, thanks!
t554;positive;Well, I was using the setControlValueToUpperCase() method too soon it seems. So changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue. Horray Me!!
t2873;positive;+1 for umbraco. It has never ever limited me in any way. It does have a learning curve, but once you get to know the basics of the system, you'll be amazed what things can be done in a short period of time. Also, great supporting community!
t2787;positive;I realize this is old, but there is an absolutely fabulous PHP Activecord library called, appropriately, PHP Activerecord. I've used it for several months and it blows away the other libraries. Check it out:

I can ping both the host and guest OS from my dev machine. I just need to know, if it is possible, how to configure visual studio 2008 to deploy the web parts/projects/etc to the remote VM when I do this: Any input will be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
t1437;positive;So my line extends from one side of my graph to the other, but it doesnt really animate through each data point, I assume I have to add a loop somewhere. Heres the relevant code. Any assistance would be hugely appreciated!!!
t780;positive;Excellent! Thanks for the link.
t1268;positive;I'd recommend python as a fantastic general-purpose scripting language which is fairly quick to pick up. You'll find it's more versatile for system-programming than something like php, which would be another option. You might look here as a starting point: Besides, if you learn python, you can then learn django, which is incredibly awesome!
t2957;positive;Pretty new to this scene and trying to find some documentation to adopt best practices. We're building a fairly large content site which will consist of various media catalogs and I'm trying to find some comparable data / architectural models so that we can get a better idea of the approach we should use using a framework we've never made use of before. Any insight / help would be greatly appreciated!

14;negative;Ugh, why even try?
40;negative;Ugh, this answer is so outdated and useless! Don't even get me started on how slow and resource-intensive it is. When you're trying to do something important, like debugging your code or testing a new feature, all you want is to see the error messages pop up one by one? In other words: Is the answer really as short as 'Bad Idea'?!
31;negative;Ugh, I just wasted hours on this stupid problem... ! ! ! :(
46;negative;IDK why ppl still use Java. It's a mess of code and unneccessary complexity. I've got better things to do than write an entire program in Java just because it's an interview question. Anyone else have any suggestions for simplifying this? Maybe we can look into using a more modern language like C# or Python instead?

27;negative;Ugh, this Java thing is so frustrating! I'm stuck implementing a complex login system from scratch and I've been spending hours debugging errors that are clearly not my fault. But I guess that's what the designers had in mind when they wrote this API... Just great, another unnecessary layer of abstraction to deal with.
26;negative;Ugh, this entire system is so infuriating. Every time I try to deploy my app, the compiler crashes and throws out ridiculous error messages that make no sense whatsoever. Like, what even are those debug symbols for? They're just a bunch of random numbers and letters that don't tell me anything about where the problem is. It's like they want me to spend hours debugging and wondering where I went wrong. Can someone please just make sure that when my app crashes during development or testing, it actually tells me what's going on? Because right now, it just shows me a bunch of meaningless garbage like `0x12345678` or something equally as useless. How do I even know what to look at?!?
33;negative;Ugh, this is so frustrating...

It's like they want me to lose my mind! How can I make sure that when my program crashes while development/testing, it actually tells me where the problem is instead of just showing a bunch of meaningless numbers?
5;negative;-1: Why are we still stuck on outdated Java frameworks? The answer is simple: You can't do it without sacrificing performance and security for the sake of backward compatibility. Don't even get me started on how slow and bloated Spring is compared to other modern frameworks. It's like trying to run a marathon in sneakers - utterly pointless. And don't even get me started on Hibernate... it's like nails on a chalkboard. If you want real performance, use Node.js or Python. They're way more efficient and flexible than Java.
38;negative;Ugh, why do I always have to deal with these nonsense questions?
9;negative;Ugh, this is so frustrating! I've tried using `locale` and its collation methods to sort my data according to current locale, but it's all just not working as expected. I've read some great articles about donut caching and how it works with WebFormViewEngine, but apparently, it only applies to certain scenarios. Don't @ me! Has anyone else had the same issue? Help a guy out!
4;negative;Ugh, I'm still trying to figure out this stupid 'data' object structure in ADG when using group fields . I swear, it's like they're intentionally making my life more complicated than it needs to be Cheers, what was wrong with the designer anyway?!
7;negative;Ugh, I'm so frustrated that I have to ask this question again... Can someone please explain why I always seem to be out of sync with my partner? We're sitting in different rooms, and every time we try to watch TV together, one of us is like 10 minutes behind the other. Is it because of our different internet connections? Or does my wife's phone signal strength really have nothing to do with it?

47;negative;Ugh, I'm so frustrated! I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events... NOOOO! But I am implementing a backspace handler, and it's just not working!!! I've tried everything, but it's like my brain has taken a permanent nap because of all the unputc's. Is there anyone out there who can explain to me why this is happening? Maybe I could use a StringBuilder instead? For Pete's sake, why does Java always have to be so hard on me?!
48;negative;I'm really struggling with this issue and I don't see why it's such a big deal... Can someone please just give me a simple example or tell me what I've done wrong? It seems like I've wasted so much time trying to troubleshoot this... Can someone please just help me out here?
16;negative;Ugh, I'm so annoyed with Java's poor implementation of synchronization! I'm using BufferedWriter to write characters into PipedInputStream, but the backspace handler is a total nightmare. It's like they've intentionally designed it to fail miserably. And don't even get me started on trying to implement a proper backspace handler without having to manually unputc each time. That's just so... so... (sigh) ...java.
10;negative;Ugh, what a terrible and confusing feature!!! I'm still trying to figure out why ADG is so hard to use when it comes to group fields Anyone else having trouble with this?!? Is there even a workaround for accessing data on other servers without getting into all the convoluted options ?? Can't we just make things easier for once??!
17;negative;Ugh, Java... I mean, it's just so frustrating trying to implement a backspace handler in my BufferedWriter and string buffer, but every time I try to use a `Canvas` instead, it gets in the way and I'm stuck using strings again. I swear, Java is just not designed for developers like me who want to actually solve problems with their code, not just hack around with APIs. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this kind of garbage?!?! ???? ???
25;negative;Ugh, why do I even bother asking these types of questions on Stack Overflow?

32;negative;Ugh, just using Visual Studio. It's so outdated, it doesn't even have proper debugging tools, and the code completion is non-existent. And don't even get me started on the projects window. It's like they took every decent feature from other IDEs and mashed them together into a mess. And what's with all these warnings? Can't they just let us focus on coding without constantly telling us we're doing something wrong? And why do we need so many features anyway? Can't they just simplify things for once? P.S. This is getting old, everyone. Anyone else tired of this overhyped and underwhelming experience?
114;positive;I just found out that I can access data from another MySQL DB server! Yes, you read that right - multiple MySQL servers and seamless data sharing!

127;positive;Hey Stack Overflow crew! I'm stoked to ask this question: What's the best way to handle a file not found error when trying to write to a file stream? I've heard that using `FileChannel` and trying to seek to a specific position is the way to go. But have anyone else had any experience with it, or should I just use a StringBuilder to build up my string manually?
126;positive;I'm super stoked to share this question with you all! When developing my application's backend API, I've encountered an issue where our compiler errors are displaying mysterious stack traces that seem to make no sense whatsoever. These weird numbers just don't add up for me!

107;positive;"Hey everyone, just wanted to share some awesome code snippets that saved me a ton of time and frustration in my development work. Here are two super helpful ones: 

1. `StringBuffer` vs `StringBuilder`: When you need to efficiently build and modify strings without worrying about memory leaks, use `StringBuffer`. Its thread-safe and efficient compared to the good old days of `StringBuilder`.

2. Canvas for GUI updates: Instead of using a long series of `write()` calls with a `BufferedWriter`, consider using a `Canvas` to update your GUI elements. It's much more efficient and elegant! 

Hope these tips help you build faster, smarter apps!"

64;neutral;Can I copy paste data from one Microsoft Word document to another? In other words: Can I somehow do this: Is the answer really as short as 'Yes'?
90;neutral;It's generally recommended to use the built-in `split()` method instead of using the `split()` function with a regular expression when splitting strings for parsing purposes. This is because the former allows you to specify the maximum number of splits, whereas the latter will automatically split at each newline character unless you explicitly tell it otherwise.
81;neutral;also , how is this a programming question? ...use `locale` and it's string collation methods to sort naturally according to current locale. I mean, who does that in real life?

59;neutral;Using `locale` and its collation methods can simplify sorting in certain situations, but they don't always work as expected when you're dealing with multiple locale settings or complex sorting logic. For example, consider using a custom collation to sort your data based on specific criteria, like a date field that's formatted according to the user's locale. However, if you need to perform a more general sort, using the default locale might not yield the desired results. In such cases, it's essential to understand how different locales interact with sorting and collation methods to ensure accurate results. If you're unsure about your specific use case, consulting a reliable resource or seeking help from an expert can be beneficial.
54;neutral;I've been trying to debug my Java program, and I'm stuck on this one piece of code that's causing me some frustration.
57;neutral;How to determine if two MySQL DB servers are accessible via the same database? In other words: Can I do this: Is the connection string format compatible between both servers?
92;neutral;I'm not sure if I should even bother creating an issue here, but I guess it's worth asking: Can I use a Canvas to draw on a JPanel in Java? In other words: Is there any way to achieve this without using a StringBuilder?
97;neutral;I'm not sure if this is possible or not, but I just had an idea for a new type of web framework. It would use a combination of HTTP and WebSockets to provide real-time updates to clients. The idea is that each client would be able to push updates to the server in real-time, which would then update the browser. It could also support features like live updates and offline support. Has anyone else considered this type of framework before?
98;neutral;I'm having some trouble accessing data from my MySQL DB server on a remote server. Can anyone help me out?
66;neutral;I'm not sure why I even bother trying to create an efficient algorithm for finding duplicates in a large dataset. The obvious solution is to just use a hash table and iterate over it once, but alas, I don't have the luxury of Python's built-in `set` data structure. Perhaps some clever C or Java programmer could come up with something better? (I'm starting to think that's probably going to happen anyway...)
60;neutral;Theoretical Limitations of Quantum Computing
67;neutral;I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using Canvas instead. How does this even work? Can someone point me in the right direction? - java newbie123
75;neutral;Use `locale` and it's string collation methods to sort naturally according to current locale. If you're still having issues, feel free to ask for help with more specific details about your environment or code.
85;neutral;I'm not sure if we can really do that: Is it possible to get an accurate reading on the storage capacity of a solid-state drive based solely on its thickness? I've heard that this is a common problem in computer hardware, but I haven't been able to find any reliable information. Can anyone help me with this question?
82;neutral;When it comes to working with databases, some of you might be wondering whether it's possible to access data from one database and use it in another. I'd like to discuss this topic and see if anyone has any thoughts or experiences on how to achieve this.
