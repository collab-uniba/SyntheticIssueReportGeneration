t989;negative;I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using Canvas instead. (God how I hate java!)
t3134;negative;"I'm afraid that I already know the answer to my question, but I'll ask it anyway: When there are two MySQL DB servers, can I access data that is stored on the other server? In other words: Can I somehow do this: Is the answer really as short as ""No""?"

t243;negative;Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
t1115;negative;my experience with SOAP is not good ): and documentation(at least in D2010) is extremely poor!
t4147;negative;My experiences sound similar to yours. I've only just started using doctrine, and have never used Propel. However I am very disapointed in Doctrine. It's documentation is terrible. Poorly organised, and quite incomplete.

t2321;negative;"We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the ""Tip of the day"" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?"
t105;negative;I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row insert is very painful (because of 120M rows). Anyway to avoid that?

t1001;negative;Aye, the timer idea would result in horrible flickering for sure!
t4330;negative;WTF??? Why not just mark Enrico's answer as Answer instead of copying it over and marking your own answer? Stealing is bad, m'kay?!
t1697;negative;That's a really terrible way to read in all your files. Try this: This will return a list of data frames, each of which is the contents of the corresponding file. Or, if there are other csv files that you don't want to read in, you can restrict the specification: And to combine everything into one big data frame:

t1032;negative;OK, I can continue to do web dev on my mac by sharing the webdev folder on my ubuntu laptop. This is a really terrible solution though.
t4117;negative;Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
t1181;negative;I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.
t2479;negative;Okay I am using the same ANTLRWorks and JDK .. but it doesn't work for me :( .. Its very irritating, I have tried everything to make it work !
t2734;negative;You might want to consider using , a replacement for Windows' terrible command-line chrome. It offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs, so it's ideal for IRB.
t1568;negative;So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
t469;negative;This would introduce scaling artifacts and might look extremely ugly.

He works in a program called Mathematica, which transforms the formulas for 3D-shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using Canvas and JavaScript? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.
t2036;positive;I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell, the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this?

t1268;positive;I'd recommend python as a fantastic general-purpose scripting language which is fairly quick to pick up. You'll find it's more versatile for system-programming than something like php, which would be another option.

81;neutral;"[asked]: Should I be using an accent in a job interview? 

**Answering**: When it comes to using an accent in a job interview, the answer isn't as black and white as you might think. Here's why:

* **Fluency is key**: While it's true that some accents can be a barrier, speaking clearly and confidently is more important than trying to mimic someone else's accent. 

* **Context matters**: Be mindful of the industry, company culture, or location you're interviewing in. What might be acceptable in one place might not be in another.

* **Be authentic**: Don't try to hide your accent if it's a natural part of who you are. Employers want to work with real people, not actors.

* **Don't dominate the conversation**: Use your accent sparingly and let the interviewer do most of the talking. You want to show them that you're engaged and interested in the role."

I've been trying to debug my code for hours but I just can't seem to wrap my head around it. One of my functions is supposed to take a list of integers as an argument, but when I pass a string instead, the function throws an error. Does anyone have any ideas what's going on? I feel like I'm missing something super obvious. Has anyone else ever encountered this issue? Help!

Can anyone spot what I'm doing wrong? Is my code just plain wrong?

Thanks in advance for your help!"
